[The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman](https://natureofcode.com/book/)

This project recreates the book examples using C++/SDL.

My goal is to learn C++/SDL and the book is an excelent source of good code to build.
Also the concepts are very interesting and explained clearly in the book.

In order to program and run the examples, I created a wrapper for P5 in C++/SDL. It mimics 
most of the functionality but it does not have the intention to fully simulate P5 in full. 

I enjoyed learning the concepts but also programming the functionality using C++/SDL.
